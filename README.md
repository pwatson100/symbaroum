  <strong style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);"><i>“Twilight falls. Davokar darkens.”</i> </strong> &nbsp; The goblin Fenya sounded calm, despite the flock of violings that swarmed eagerly around them – the nasty birds could predict bloodshed, they all knew that.
  Kvarek felt the sweat on his palms threaten his grip on the spear and shouted over his shoulder: <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“Magdala, faster!”</i> &nbsp; The witch didn’t answer, lost as she was to the sinister harmonies of the ritual, her hands caressing the pillar’s grim stone face.
  <br>
  A loud rumbling echoed through the ruin, as if some giant creature had awoken and stood up from under layer upon layer of stone and soil.
  <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“The witch said that the abominations come out at night,”</i> &nbsp; the goblin muttered.
  Kvarek’s knuckles whitened as he tightened the grip: <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“No, only that they are hungriest after dark.
    They are not afraid of the evening sun, and not of …”</i> <br> He was cut short by Magdala’s hoarse voice: <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“The pillar has answered.
    I know where the mausoleum is.”</i>
  <br>
  Then, out of the ruins, the blight beast came at them, massive and roaring. &nbsp;
  Its claws scraped the rocky ground, scouring out deep sores oozing pure corruption, leaving drops of black, mercury-like mildew on moss and stones in its wake.
  <br>
  <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“We cannot escape this,”</i> &nbsp; said Fenya. Magdala nodded agreement.
  <br>
  <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“Well then,”</i> &nbsp; Kvarek sighed,
  <i style="color: hsl(19, 49%, 59%);">“this is where we make our stand, for the right to the treasures of Symbaroum.”</i>
