We expect the new version to be released when the commercial modules have a v10 version available. So the new version <b>is not out yet.</b><br /><br /> An important note that the Symbaroum system will only support upgrading to Foundry v10 from Symbaroum v3.1.8. If you are currently on Symbaroum v3.1.8 or newer than you are all prepared.<br /><br />If your system is older than 3.1.8, then we encourage you to upgrade to Symbaroum v3.1.8, as we can't guarantee a safe migration from older releases.  Remember that always, when upgrading systems to make a backup - see <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU'>Foundry tutorial for backups</a>. <br/><br/><b>With Foundry, only you can prevent data loss</b><br/><br/> If you have to do a manual upgrade to v3.1.8 because foundry does not allow you to upgrade, please see https://foundryvtt.com/article/tutorial/ for how to perform a manual installation - the  manifest for Symbaroum 3.1.8 can be found <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/pwatson100/symbaroum/releases/tag/3.1.8'>https://github.com/pwatson100/symbaroum/releases/tag/3.1.8</a> - There you can right click and select 'copy link' on the system.json and use that for your manual installation. <br/><br/> If you have questions and/or need help, ping us on either on #symbaroum-vtt-foundry on Davokar Explorers Discord or the #free-league channel on Foundry discord."

            "message":"<h1>Avoding pain</h1><br />In the next couple of weeks, give or take, Symbaroum and the commercial modules will go to v10.  As part of that, it is prudent to remind everyone that <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmbxMmqNNXU'><b>backups are important</b></a>. Once a world has been upgraded to v10, it can't go back unless you have a backup.  <br/>Remember to check your key modules work in v10, as they might not be available yet. If you are unsure and would like to test to see what works and what does not work in v10, you can follow the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74ZAp3xx3o'>guide for running two</a> (or more) versions of Foundry on the same machine.
